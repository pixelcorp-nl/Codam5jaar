# Workshop Pixelcorp

Time: 14:10 - 14:55 && 15:10 - 15:55 (45 min)
Staff contact: Daniel / Welmoed
Organization:
    Joppe, Mees, Kenny & Oswin
Team: 8 Volunteers + Organization team.
There are 60 spots available for participants per workshop.

## Goal

Introduce the guests to programming.
The participants will have a basic understanding of what coding looks like.
But most importantly we want them to have a good time exploring coding!

## Execution

We will use a very similar workshop to what is currently online at pixelcorp.nl/info.
There will be less tune tghan we usually have for a workshop so the exercises will be tweaked slightly.
First we will remove the earlier python introduction because this can take up to much time.
Secondly we will simplify the code for placing a single pixel.
After the single pixel exercise we will have a couple of exercises with slightly increased difficulty.
- single pixel
- color challenges (2x)
- line challenge
- square challenge

We will keep only one expert challenge at the end.
- circle challenge

## Benodigheden

- Auditorium? (might take to much time, brainstorm alternative)
- Server at codam? (will probably use this and have multiple backup options on our own servers).
